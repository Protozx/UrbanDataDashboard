I wasn’t the type to watch unsettling things, but something about it pulled me in. I slid the tape into the player, the screen flickering to life.

                        At first, it was just a dimly lit room. Figures sat around a table, their faces hidden in shadows, but their eyes—wide, unsettling—were locked on the camera. I felt a strange chill as I watched, unable to look away. The camera zoomed in on one of the figures, and the eye became the focal point, twitching unnaturally. It was as if the eye knew it was being watched, aware in a way that felt... wrong.</p><h6 class="mt-3 igris">fecha de subida</h6>
